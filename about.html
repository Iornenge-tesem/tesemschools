        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Tesem Model Schools was founded in 2005 with a clear purpose — to
          provide accessible, high-quality education in a disciplined and
          nurturing environment. What started as a small nursery and primary
          school with a handful of dedicated teachers has grown into a full
          nursery, primary, and secondary institution serving hundreds of
          families across the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we have consistently produced outstanding academic
          results, with our students excelling in national examinations
          including WAEC, NECO, and common entrance tests. Our growth is a
          testament to the trust parents place in us and the commitment of
          our teachers and management team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Tesem Model Schools continues to set the standard for
          private education — blending academic rigour with moral instruction
          to raise well-rounded, confident, and responsible young people.

        <p>
          At Tesem Model Schools, we believe that effective education begins with
          strong leadership and transparent governance. Our management team is
          composed of experienced educators and administrators who work
          collaboratively with parents, teachers, and the wider community to
          uphold the highest standards of academic delivery and student welfare.
        </p>
        <p>
          We foster a culture of accountability, continuous professional
          development, and open communication. Every decision we make is guided
          by a single question: <strong>"Is this in the best interest of the
          child?"</strong> This principle drives our policies, teaching methods,
          resource allocation, and community engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach combines structured discipline with compassion, ensuring
          that students are motivated to achieve their potential in a supportive
          and orderly environment. We are committed to transparency and welcome
          parents as active partners in their children's education.
